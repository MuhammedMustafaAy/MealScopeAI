## 🚀 Features

- 🍽️ **Meal Detection**  
  Detects food items from either images or text-based menus using AI models (YOLO, NLP).
  
- 🧠 **Classification System**  
  Categorizes food into types:
  - Main Dish
  - Side Dish
  - Dessert
  - Beverage
  - Meat-based / Vegetarian / Vegan

- 💰 **Price Estimation**
